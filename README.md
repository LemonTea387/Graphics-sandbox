# Graphics-sandbox
A place where I keep track of things to play around with graphics (currently OpenGL only). 
It is a selector of 'scenes' that are different scenarios to play around with.

## TODO
- [] Configurables in every scene using Imgui
- [] Input system for programs to interact directly
- [] Graphics backend abstraction, scenes can use a common interface.
- [] Vulkan?
